# game-server-poller
A python script to poll game servers and write server and match data back to a Mongo database with mongoengine.

The plan is to get this to work first with my UT server query library (https://github.com/cwilkc/utserverquery) to accompany my Unreal Tournament 99 server.

Secondly, develop a Valve source poller which will perform the same tasks as the UT server query library but for Quake Live games to accompany my Quake Live server.
